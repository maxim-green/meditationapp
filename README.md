# Meditation Assistant
Mobile app for meditation practice.
Unfortunately it's only for Android, because i don't have iOS to test the app.

## Features
- Meditation timer. Minimum duration is one minute, maximum - 60 minutes.
- Meditation ends with a gentle bell sound. Volume is independent from system volume, so you can enable silent mode on your phone if you dont want to be interrupted. You can set up bell volume in app settings.
- When you complete meditation there is a popup where you can input your mood and take a note
- History of completed meditations. Includes such data as date, duration, note, mood, moon phase etc. 
- Dark theme included
